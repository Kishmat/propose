# Propose Your Crush

This project demonstrates two interactive button behaviors using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

- **Model 1**: The button disappears when the user attempts to hover over it.
- **Model 2**: Two buttons are displayed, and when hovered, their positions are swapped.

## Features

- **Model 1**: A button vanishes as soon as the user tries to hover over it.
- **Model 2**: Two buttons appear on the screen, and when either of them is hovered, their positions are swapped.
- Fun and interactive ways to impress your **Crush** based on user hover interactions!

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the page and buttons.
- **CSS**: For styling the buttons and implementing hover effects.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the button disappearance and swapping functionality.
